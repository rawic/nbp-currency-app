### üîß Improvements / Future Enhancements

This section outlines potential improvements that could be implemented in the project to enhance its functionality, performance, and maintainability:

- **Improve API Error Handling**: Enhance error handling in terms of UX/UI to give users a clearer understanding when issues occur.
- **Skeleton Loading State**: Add skeletons or loading indicators when fetching data to improve the user experience.
- **Leverage Streaming More**: Increase the use of streaming for data fetching, as currently some parts of the content are blocked while waiting for data.
- **Separate Fetchers into Files**: Move data fetching logic into separate files to adhere to better code organization and separation of concerns.
- **Testing**: Introduce at least unit tests to ensure code quality and reliability.
- **API Rate Limiting**: Implement mechanisms to prevent users from spamming the API with too many requests.
- **Husky for Pre-Commit Hooks**: Use Husky to run linting and Prettier checks on each commit to maintain code style and quality automatically.
- **Reusable Components**: Add more reusable components (e.g., buttons) to improve maintainability and consistency across the app.
